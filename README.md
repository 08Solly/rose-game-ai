## Running a self driving module locally

Clone this repository, and make sure you have a game engine running.

Install requirements:

```bash
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Write your own driving module, you can use the file `mydriver.py`:

```bash
vi mydriver.py
```

Run using `mydriver.py` as the driving module:

```bash
python main.py --driver mydriver.py
```

## Running ROSE game components containerized

### Running the game engine ( on http://127.0.0.1:8880 )

``` bash
podman run --rm --network host -it quay.io/rose/rose-game-engine:latest
```

### Running the game web based user interface ( on http://127.0.0.1:8080 )

``` bash
podman run --rm --network host -it quay.io/rose/rose-game-web-ui:latest
```

### Running your self driving module, requires a local `driver.py` file with your driving module. ( on http://127.0.0.1:8081 )

``` bash
# NOTE: will mount mydriver.py from local directory into the container file system
podman run --rm --network host -it \
  -v $(pwd)/:/driver:z \
  -e DRIVER=/driver/mydriver.py \
  quay.io/rose/rose-game-ai:latest
```

### Testing your driver

Send `car` and `track` information by uring `POST` request to your driver ( running on http://127.0.0.1:8081 ):

``` bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "info": {
                "car": {
                    "x": 3,
                    "y": 8
                }
            },
            "track": [
                ["", "", "bike", "", "", ""],
                ["", "crack", "", "", "trash", ""],
                ["", "", "penguin", "", "", "water"],
                ["", "water", "", "trash", "", ""],
                ["barrier", "", "", "", "bike", ""],
                ["", "", "trash", "", "", ""],
                ["", "crack", "", "", "", "bike"],
                ["", "", "", "penguin", "water", ""],
                ["", "", "bike", "", "", ""]
            ]
        }' http://localhost:8081/
```

The response in `JSON` format should include the car name and the recommended action:

``` json
{
  "info": {
    "name": "Go Cart",
    "action": "pickup"
  }
}
```
